The reports are based on the Housing Inventory Count (HIC), an inventory of housing conducted on a single night during the last ten days in January. It reflects the number of beds and units available on the night designated for the count that are dedicated to serve persons who are homeless. The HIC also includes information about unmet need.\nNote: This information has not been independently verified by HUD. Where possible, CoCs are encouraged to use HMIS data to generate the HIC. Since compliance with these standards may vary, the reliability and consistency of the homeless counts may also vary among CoCs. Additionally, a shift in the methodology a CoC uses to count the homeless may cause a change in homeless counts between reporting periods. These reports are available starting in 2005.", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "https://www.hudexchange.info/manage-a-program/coc-housing-inventory-count-reports/", "mediaType": "application/pdf"}], "identifier": "HUD166", "keyword": ["CoC", "Count", "HIC", "HMIS", "Housing", "Inventory", "Reports"], "modified": "P1Y", "programCode": ["025:008"], "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "US Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "temporal": "2005/2014", "title": "CoC Housing Inventory Count Reports"}
