    "According to the Regional Task Force (1), over the past five years unsheltered homeless persons in San Diego has increased steadily while sheltered homeless persons has decreased. With the multitude of programs and services implemented by both the state and the federal government, it is disturbing that homeless populations continue to increase. Although the the homeless crisis in San Diego and many other communities is an extremely complex issue to tackle, communities such as Bergen, New Jersey (in partnership with an organization called Community Solutions) with a population of about one million people has proved that it is not impossible (2). The three main strategies that they used to address homelessness were: coordination between service providers, a commitment to a housing-first solution, and a data driven systems framework. Communities like Bergen that have focused on the US war veteran homeless population have demonstrated that with the right strategy, homelessness can be reduced to “functional zero” (3).\n",
    "\tOne of the key components involved in Bergen’s response to their homeless crisis was changing the housing services provided and specifically advocating for a housing-first strategy rather than shelters. One important element to a housing-first approach is identify what types of housing services are most suitable depending on an individual’s needs and will further prevent them from returning to homelessness. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (4) recently published a study on different housing services provided to families. They discovered that families who were administered stable housing solutions such as Rapid Re-housing and Long-term Housing Subsidies rather than Transitional Housing or Emergency Shelters demonstrated more benefits (cheaper, better quality of life) over a three year period. In addition, the overall cost for each family was the lowest for Rapid Re-Housing than the other services. This provides evidence that services vary in their efficiency to provide individuals with the resources they need. It is time for San Diego to change its approach to tackling the homeless crisis and allocate its resources to housing strategies that are actually benefiting the people that need them the most. Not only does it benefit the taxpayers by increasing the efficiency of government spending, but it more importantly improves the quality of life of people who are so underserved in San Diego today. \n",

    "After speaking with Voytek he suggesting we use data scraping. We plan on meeting with him to to over this method with some of our data. This will require extensive manual data input into cohesive excel spreadsheets (or possibly csv) so they can be analyzed appropriately. The rest will be going through extraction, integration and aggregation (filtering process).  Once we have gone through these we’ll be throwing out unneeded information that was integrated in our data collection. For example, the data from the housing inventory is in an excel file. The file has a few missing data points and data that will not be useful for purpose so we will need to drop certain columns. \n",

    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)*\n",
    "For our analysis portion we will be dividing them into data profiling and data mining areas. A few of the data analysis tools we could potentially be using would be Migration Architect (Evoke Software) and Data mining Suit (Informative Discovery).  Migration Architect  will help us with the attributes of our data such as: data type, length, cardinality, discrete values and their percentage, minimum and maximum values, missing values, and uniqueness. We would start by plotting the data and look for potential outliers. Then most likely look at multiple linear regression model for how the services provided are related to helping in overcoming the homeless crisis. This will allow us to visualize the data and make predictive models about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some of our data requires some pre-processing, the data from the San Diego Homeless Dashboard is in a pdf format which means that we will have to parse the data into a json file or csv file manually. Also, since the  RTFHSD has not given us their data yet, we do not know if there is going to be major pre-processing or not. \n",

    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)*\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to report from our data that our hypotheses is correct. Key visualization we plan to create is a histogram that shows what housing services the city distributes its resources for homelessness. We will attempt to show which of those programs have the highest success rate and utilization. Then cross list to see if the city is distributing its resources correctly. Finally, we will be able to compare the differences between housing services in each city of the county of San Diego and evaluate the differences between Success rates across cities. \n",

    "With analyzing data to a incredibly complex crisis such as homelessness it of course falls into potential confounds that can have an effect on our analysis. One issue with collecting data on homelessness in general is actually getting concrete data since those falling in and out of homelessness is so dynamic and changes constantly. We have to assume that the data we have received is an incomplete picture of the true population of homeless individuals in San Diego. Essentially what we have received is just a sample at a particular point of time and we are making observations based on that and assuming that the observations can be extended beyond those temporal and physical boundaries. \n",
    "\tIn addition, data collected from HMIS is incomplete as most people utilize the system (required to input data into the system if receiving funding from HUD), yet not all organizations that are servicing the homeless are utilizing this system (receiving funds from somewhere other than HUD). So that is valuable data again that we are missing. \n",
    "Other confounds we may come across would be structural conflicts we may come across since we are using a variation of data sets not strictly limiting ourselves to csv or json files. With some of our data we will be creating our own files and individually inputting the data which can carry out typos, misspelling, redundancy, duplicates or man made errors. \n",
    "We are confident in our hypotheses from the research we have conducted so far, and our proposed methods for analyzing the data. However, should our methods or hypotheses be incorrect we will possibly focus on a specific subpopulation of the homeless, like Veterans or Youth for example, and utilize the data resource to predict the most effective housing strategy for that specific subpopulation. Should our methods fail we will continue to seek other ways of visualizing and structuring the data. Many times in data science we stumble across findings we weren’t even searching for or reach complications we could have never anticipated. Although these will be a challenge we are open in being flexible with our methodology. "
